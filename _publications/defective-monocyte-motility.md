excerpt: 'Alveolar macrophages, sentinel cells essential to pulmonary immunity, mature during perinatal development. Fetal monocytes arrive in the lungs during late embryonic development and mature into alveolar macrophages through a pre-alveolar macrophage intermediate. Here we identify a requirement for the actin-bundling protein L-plastin (LPL) in a key transition during neonatal alveolar macrophage development. LPL−/− mice demonstrated a two-fold reduction in alveolar macrophages. The requirement for LPL was cell-intrinsic, as mice expressing a CD11c-specific deletion of LPL (CD11c.Cre-LPLfl/fl mice) also exhibited a significant (> 75%) reduction in alveolar macrophages. Impaired alveolar macrophage development in LPL−/− mice resulted from a block in the transition of the intermediate pre-alveolar macrophages to mature alveolar macrophages. Differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages requires transit to the alveolar space, which exposes precursor cells to the essential growth factor GM-CSF, which in turn upregulates the transcription factor PPAR-γ. LPL is required for monocyte migration into the alveoli, providing a mechanism by which LPL deficiency impairs alveolar macrophage maturation. As predicted by this model, pre-alveolar macrophages in LPL−/− mice did not upregulate PPAR-γ, indicating that exposure to GM-CSF is reduced. Finally, LPL−/−, CD11c.Cre-LPLfl/fl and CD11c.Cre-LPLfl/+ mice failed to efficiently clear pulmonary pneumococcal infection, revealing a physiological consequence of impaired alveolar macrophage development. In summary, we show that genetic disruption of monocyte motility can impair differentiation of a key cell type, subsequently impairing host immunity.'
