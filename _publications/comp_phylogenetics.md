excerpt: 'Meiotic recombination is an integral cellular process, required for the production of viable gametes. Recombination rate is a fundamental genomic parameter, modulating genomic responses to selection. Our increasingly detailed understanding of its molecular underpinnings raises the prospect that we can gain insight into trait divergence by examining the molecular evolution of recombination genes from a pathway perspective, as in mammals, where protein-coding changes in later stages of the recombination pathway are connected to divergence in intra-clade recombination rate. Here, we leverage increased availability of avian and teleost genomes to reconstruct the evolution of the recombination pathway across two additional vertebrate clades: birds, which have higher and more variable rates of recombination and similar divergence times to mammals, and teleost fish, which have much deeper divergence times. Rates of molecular evolution of recombination genes are highly correlated between vertebrate clades and significantly elevated compared to control panels, suggesting that they experience similar selective pressures. Avian recombination genes are significantly more likely to exhibit signatures of positive selection than other clades, unrestricted to later stages of the pathway. Signatures of positive selection in genes linked to recombination rate variation in mammalian populations and those with signatures of positive selection across the avian phylogeny are highly correlated. In contrast, teleost fish recombination genes have significantly less evidence of positive selection despite high intra-clade recombination rate variability. Gaining clade-specific understanding of patterns of variation in recombination genes can elucidate drivers of recombination rate and thus, factors influencing genetic diversity, selection efficacy, and species divergence.'
